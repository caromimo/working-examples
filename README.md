# Working examples

This repo is a collection of working examples to accomplish specific tasks. It is my personal go-to resource place where I want to save how to do specific tasks that I looked into. Most of what will be included in this repo will not be my work as I will use existing materials to which I will be adding. Attribution will always be provided.
